"Day 22: Wizard Simulator 20XX
 
 Wizard
 Same turn format as day 21, same win condition - 0 HP loses
 Or lose if you can't cast a spell
 damage still floored at 1
 Spells cost mana
 
 Magic Missile 
   53 mana.
   does 4 damage.
 Drain 
   73 mana. 
   does 2 damage 
   heals 2 hit points.
 Shield 
   113 mana. 
   armor increased 7 
   for 6 turns.
 Poison 
   173 mana. 
   3 damage per turn.
   for 6 turns
 Recharge 
   229 mana. 
   +101 mana
   for 5 turns
 
 Effects apply at the start of both the player's turns and the boss' turns
   
start with 50 hit points and 500 mana points
Boss: Hit Points: 71 Damage: 10
   
What is the least amount of mana you can spend and still win the fight? 
(Do not include mana recharge effects as spending negative mana.)

"Don't think there's a way to solve without simulating turns. Search algorithm maybe?
 state->spell->state, where state are the player and boss

 Probably need a better model of the players that includes which effects are active on them"

"Concept inventory

 * won? lost? :: state -> bool
 * turn :: state, spell -> state

 * attack :: state -> state
 * apply-effects :: state -> state
 * effect-expire :: effects -> effects 
 * has-effect? :: state, effect -> bool

 * spell probably want a function for each
 * effect tuple of name, turns.
 * player [hp mana effects]
 * opponent [hp damage effects]
 * 
 
  You cannot cast a spell that would start an effect which is already active. However, effects can be started on the same turn they end."
